1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,799
I took the supermarket flowers from
the windowsill

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,680
Threw the day old tea from the cup

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,920
Packed up the photo album Matthew
had made

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,360
Memories of a life that’s been loved

5
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:37,379
Took the get well soon cards and
stuffed animals

6
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:43,199
Poured the old ginger beer down
the sink

7
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,839
Dad always told me don’t you cry
when you’re down

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,900
But mum there’s a tear every time
that I blink

9
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,680
Oh I’m in pieces it’s tearing me
up but I know

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,520
A heart that’s broke is a heart
that’s been loved

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,380
So I’ll sing Hallelujah,

12
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,619
You were an
angel in the shape of my mum

13
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,699
When I fell down you’d be there
holding me up

14
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,379
Spread your wings as you go
And when

15
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:28,679
God takes you back
He’ll say Hallelujah, you’re home

16
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,920
I fluffed the pillows, made the
beds, stacked the chairs up

17
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,260
Folded your nightgowns neatly
in a case

18
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,880
John said he’d drive, then put his
hand on my cheek

19
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:58,139
And wiped a tear from the side
of my face

20
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:03,799
I hope that I see the world as you
did cause I know

21
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:07,739
A life with love is a life that’s
been lived

22
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:11,619
So I’ll sing Hallelujah,

23
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:17,079
you were an
angel in the shape of my mum

24
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,700
When I fell down you’d be there
holding me up

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,400
Spread your wings as you go, when
God takes you back

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,660
He’ll say Hallelujah, you’re home

27
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,540
Hallelujah,

28
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,800
you were an angel in the
shape of my mum

29
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,379
You got to see the person that
I have become

30
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:28,519
Spread your wings and I know
That when

31
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,020
God took you back, he said

32
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,200
Hallelujah you’re home
